# Documentation for the SSGeek Online Store

## Overview

The SSGeek Online Store is a simplistic web-based application designed to display a range of humorous products. It consists of two main components:

- An HTML file (`index.html`) responsible for rendering the user interface of the application.
- A JavaScript file (`productService.js`) which contains the data and logic related to the products.

## `index.html` File Structure

This file provides the main user interface for the application. Here's a quick overview of the various sections:

- **`<head>`** includes the meta tags, the title of the application, links to the CSS stylesheets and scripts. 

- **`<header>`** contains an image used as a banner for the website.

- **`<nav>`** provides navigation options including 'Home', 'Cart', and 'Logout'.

- **`<div id="search-bar">`** is a search bar that users can use to search for products by name.

- **`<main id="main-grid">`** serves as the main area where product cards are displayed.

- **`<footer>`** is the footer of the page, containing copyright information.

## `productService.js` File Structure

This JavaScript file serves two main purposes: it defines the product data and handles user interactions. Here's an overview of its structure:

- **`allProducts`** is an array that holds all the product objects available in the store.

- **`getProducts()`** is a method that returns all the products when called.

- **Event Listeners** are set up to perform actions when the DOM content has fully loaded and when the user types in the search bar.

- **`productToArticle(product)`** is a function that takes a product object as an argument and creates an HTML element (`<article>`) to represent the product.

- **`searchProducts(searchTerm)`** is a function that filters the products based on a provided search term, and then renders the filtered products in the UI.

## User Interactions

Users can interact with the application in the following ways:

- **View products**: Users can view all products as they are displayed on the homepage.

- **Search for products**: Users can type in the search bar to filter the products based on their names.

- **View product details**: Users can click on the product name to view a brief description of the product.

- **Add to cart**: Users can click on the cart icon next to each product to add it to their shopping cart.
